# Tessera

A stateless Java implementation responsible for encryption and decryption of private transaction data and for off-chain private messaging. Each Tessera node:

  - Generates and maintains a number of private/public key pairs
  
  - Self manages and discovers all nodes (i.e. their public keys) in the network by connecting to as little as one other node
    
  - Provides Private and Public API interfaces for communication
    - Private API - This is used for communication with Quorum
    - Public API - This is used for communication between Tessera peer nodes
    
  - Provides two way SSL using TLS certificates and various trust models like Trust On First Use (TOFU), whitelist, 
    certificate authority, etc.
    
  - Supports IP whitelist
  
  - Connects to any SQL DB which supports the JDBC client


## Building Tessera

1. Install the required runtime dependencies
2. Checkout the project from GitHub
3. Build using Maven


### Runtime Dependencies
Tessera has the following runtime dependencies which must be installed.

#### junixsocket
1. Get `junixsocket-1.3-bin.tar.bz2` from https://code.google.com/archive/p/junixsocket/downloads
2. Unpack it
3. `sudo mkdir -p /opt/newsclub/lib-native`
4. `sudo cp junixsocket-1.3/lib-native/libjunixsocket-macosx-1.5-x86_64.dylib /opt/newsclub/lib-native/`

junixsocket will unpack the required dependencies if they are not found.
By default, they get unpacked to `/tmp`, but this can be
changed by setting the system property `"org.newsclub.net.unix.library.path"`.

Alternatively, you can install the dependency yourself and point the 
above system property to the install location.

### Selecting an NaCl Implementation 
Tessera can be built with different NaCl cryptography implementations:

#### jnacl

`mvn install`

#### kalium
 
 Install kalium as detailed on the [kalium project page](https://github.com/abstractj/kalium), then run
 
`mvn install -Pkalium`


## Running Tessera
`java -jar tessera-app/target/tessera-app-${version}-app.jar -configfile config.json`

Once Tessera has been configured and built, you may want to copy the .jar to another location, create an alias and add it to your PATH:

`alias tessera="java -jar /somewhere/application-${version}-app.jar"`

You will then be able to more concisely use the Tessera CLI commands, such as:

```
tessera -configfile /path/to/config.json
```

and

```
tessera help
```

### Constellation migration
For installations that use the constellation configuration the following deprecated options are available. When creating the alias to run tessera you can provide an additional system property 

`alias tessera="java -Dtessera.config.legacy=true -jar /somewhere/application-${version}-app.jar"`

Most of the constallation configation parameters are supported. [link](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/constellation,"Constellation docs") with the exception of the following: 

* generatekeys - Generate keys is available using the non legacy config. 
* storage - bdb and dir are no longer supported. While storage is still supported it now only handles sqliite, memory or any jdbc url of your choosing. As with Constellation the storage has no credentials. 

#### Data migration instructions (dir or bdb stores)
To Migrate legacy datastore to tessera there is a db migration tool, for this example we'll use tessera-data-migration as the command name.

`alias tessera-data-migration="java -jar /somewhere/data-migration-${version}.jar"`

To migrate from dbd databases to tessera you must first export your existing store using `db_dump`

For example
`db_dump -f exported.txt c1/cnÂ§.db/payload.db`

```
tessera-data-migration -storetype bdb -inputpath exported.txt
```

For dir storage 
```
tessera-data-migration -storetype dir -inputpath /pathtodir
```
TODO: Add export options document. Add print out of tessera-data-migration -help


By default, Tessera uses an H2 database.  To use an alternative database, add the necessary drivers to the classpath:

`java -cp some-jdbc-driver.jar -jar /somewhere/tessera-app.jar`

## Configuration

### Config File

A config file including database, server and network peer information must be provided using the `-configfile`
command line property.  A sample configuration file can be found [here](/config/src/test/resources/sample_full.json).

### Cryptographic Keys
Tessera uses cryptographic keys to provide transaction privacy.  You can use an existing private/public key pair or have Tessera generate a new key pair for you.

#### Using existing keys
Existing keys can be included in `config.json` in one of two ways:
- __Directly__ (preferred): 
```
    "keys": [
        {
            "privateKey": "yAWAJjwPqUtNVlqGjSrBmr1/iIkghuOh1803Yzx9jLM=",
            "publicKey": "/+UuD63zItL1EbjxkKUljMgG8Z1w0AJ8pNOR4iq2yQc="
        }
```                                                                    
- __Indirectly__ (as used in legacy implementations of Tessera):  
 The private key is provided indirectly through additional config, e.g.
```
{
    "config": {
        "data": {
            "bytes": "yAWAJjwPqUtNVlqGjSrBmr1/iIkghuOh1803Yzx9jLM="
        },
        "type": "unlocked"
    },
    "publicKey": "+UuD63zItL1EbjxkKUljMgG8Z1w0AJ8pNOR4iq2yQc="
}
```

```
{
    "config": {
        "data": {
            "aopts": {
                "variant": "id",
                "memory": 1048576,
                "iterations": 10,
                "parallelism": 4,
            },
            "password": "password",
            "snonce": "x3HUNXH6LQldKtEv3q0h0hR4S12Ur9pC",
            "asalt": "7Sem2tc6fjEfW3yYUDN/kSslKEW0e1zqKnBCWbZu2Zw=",
            "sbox": "d0CmRus0rP0bdc7P7d/wnOyEW14pwFJmcLbdu2W3HmDNRWVJtoNpHrauA/Sr5Vxc"
        },
        "type": "argon2sbox"
    },
    "publicKey": "+UuD63zItL1EbjxkKUljMgG8Z1w0AJ8pNOR4iq2yQc="
}
```

#### Generating keys
If keys do not already exist they can be generated using the `-keygen` option. 

```
tessera -configfile config.json -keygen /path/to/config1 /path/to/config2
```

Where `/path/to/config*` are configuration files used in the creation of private keys.  Example configs include:
- Plaintext key:
```
{
    "type": "unlocked"
}
```

- Password protected key:
```
{ 
    "data": {
        "aopts": {
            "variant": "id",
            "memory": 1048576,
            "iterations": 10,
            "parallelism": 4,

        },
        "password": "passwordToUse",
    },
    "type": "argon2sbox"
}
```




## Interface Details

##### HTTP (Public API)

Tessera Nodes communicate with each other for:

- Node/Network discovery
- Sending/Receiving encrypted payload.

The following endpoints are advertised on this interface:

- /version
- /upcheck
- /push
- /resend
- /partyinfo
- /delete

##### Unix Domain Socket (Private API)

Quorum uses this API to:
- Check if the local Tessera node is running.
- Send and receive details of private transactions(hash).

The following endpoints are advertised on this interface:
- /version
- /upcheck
- /sendraw
- /receiveraw

## API Details

**version** - _Get Tessera version_

- Returns the version of Tessera that is running.

**upcheck** - _Check Tessera node is running_

- Returns the text "I'm up!"

**push** - _Push transactions between nodes_

- Persist encrypted payload received from another node.

**resend** - _Resend transaction_

- Resend all transactions for given key or given hash/recipient.

**partyinfo** - _Retrieve details of known nodes_

- Request public keys/url of all known peer nodes.

**sendraw** - _Send transaction bytestring_

- Send transaction payload bytestring from Quorum to Tessera node. Tessera send transaction hash in the response back. 

**receiveraw** - _Receive transaction bytestring_ 

- Receive decrypted bytestring of the transaction payload from Tessera to Quorum for transations it is party to.

**delete** - _Delete a transaction_ 

- Delete hashed encrypted payload stored in Tessera nodes.

## How It Works

### Quorum - Tessera Data Privacy Flow Diagram

<img src='https://github.com/QuorumEngineering/tessera/blob/master/Tessera%20Privacy%20flow.jpeg'/>


- Each Tessera node hosts a number of key pairs and public keys are advertised 
over public API

- Nodes can be started with information from just one other node to achieve network 
synchronization

- When a node starts up, it will reach out to every other node to 
share/receive the public keys hosted. The heartbeat is sent every 
two seconds for resynchronization. Each node will maintain the same public key 
registry after synchronization and can start sending messages to any known public key.

- When Quorum node starts up it connects to its local Tessera node using the
/upcheck API and is now ready to process private transactions.

- When Quorum sends transaction to its local node using /sendraw API, 

    1. The local node first validates the sender's public key.
    
    2. The local node checks for private key and once validated begins to encrypts
       the payload by
       
       - Generating a symmetric key and random nonce
       - Generate a recipient nonce 
       - Encrypt the payload using the symmetric key and random nonce
       - Hash this encrypted payload using SHA3 algorithm
       - For each recipient, encrypt the symmetric key with recipient nonce 
         and recipient public key 
    
    3. The local node stores the payload locally and transmits the encrypted 
       payload, encrypted symmetric key and both random and recipient nonce to each 
       recipient using public API '/push'. Each recipient will regenerate the hash 
       using same algorithm for local storage.

    4. Once all nodes have confirmed receipt and storage of the payload,
       the local node returns the '/sendraw' API call successfully with the
       hash of encrypted payload to Quorum node.

    5. Quorum then propogates the transaction hash to rest of the network using 
       Ethereum P2P protocol.
    
    6. The leader Quorum node then creates the block with this transaction 
       which is distributed across the network through 'Raft transport layer'. 
       All nodes will attempt to process it using '/receiveraw' API.
       
    7. Each local node will look for the hash and abort if not found. When 
       found, the node will use information about sender and its private key
       to decrypt the symmetric key and the decrypt the transaction payload
       using the now decrypted symmetric key and return the '/receiveraw' API
       successfully with the decrypted transaction data. which is then stored
       in the private store DB.
      

## What's next in Tessera

We will continously improve Tessera performance and in the next release we are looking at 
enhancing resiliency of Tessera nodes like

  - Providing internal cluster of Tessera nodes for heightened recoverability
  
  - Continue with transaction processing even if recipient node is down
  
  - Automatically recover private transactions from peer nodes after data loss
  
  - Providing windows support 
  
  - Healthcheck - Implement monitoring of nodes heartbeat, network availability, throughput
                  peer connections etc.
                  
  - End to End performance profiling.
